% The style of this template is to include all the packages in this main file. Any additional settings for each package is handled in a seperate file, included right after the package includes. This allows for easier optimization.

% Any layout changes should be handled in the "layout.tex" file, while any additional macros should be added in "macros.tex" or "luamacros.tex".

% The main document is handled in "document.tex".

% This template requires compilation with LuaLaTeX, in order to enable the custom environments. Since minted is included by default, it is required to invoke the compilation with "-shell-escape".
